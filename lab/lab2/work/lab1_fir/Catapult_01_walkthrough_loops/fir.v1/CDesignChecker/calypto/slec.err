<WRN>[CDB-PHNSL]  Port 'spec.rst' was not connected to any downstream logic, or the original logic has been optimized away.
<WRN>[TDB-PHNF]   Constraint is applied to port 'spec.rst' which has no fanout.

<WRN>[CTS-SVNF]   Could not find variable(s) 'spec.spec_wrapper::input::rdy'. Corresponding flop map(s) are skipped.
<WRN>[UI-GWM]     No properties found in the designs to check. Check if appropriate property checking verification mode was used.
<WRN>[TDB-UBIE]   Unmapped black-box instances exist. Please refer to file '/RAID2/COURSE/asoc/asoc020/Catapult_1/fir.v1/./CDesignChecker/calypto/bbox.log' for a complete list of unmapped black-box instances.

<WRN>[TDB-UBIP]   Unmapped ports for black-box instances exist. Please refer to file '/RAID2/COURSE/asoc/asoc020/Catapult_1/fir.v1/./CDesignChecker/calypto/bbox.log' for a complete list of unmapped ports of black-box instances.

<WRN>[TDB-PUP]    Unmapped output/blackbox-input ports have been disconnected by logic pruning and will not show up in any SLEC generated waveforms. Please refer to '/RAID2/COURSE/asoc/asoc020/Catapult_1/fir.v1/./CDesignChecker/calypto/mapping.log' for the list of unmapped outputs. Please use the global setting 'set_global prune_unmapped_logic 0' to get SLEC to dump these ports in waveforms.
<WRN>[TDB-DRF]    Some flops have been removed by dead/unmapped logic pruning. Please refer to '/RAID2/COURSE/asoc/asoc020/Catapult_1/fir.v1/./CDesignChecker/calypto/mapping.log' for the list of removed flops.
